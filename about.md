I'm Denise. I'm a software engineer in London. I am originally from New Jersey, and no, I do not have *that* accent.

### Portfolio

All the tech talks that I've ever given can be found [here](https://slides.com/deniseyu). Work stuff is on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deniseyu/).

My Open Source work is on [Github](http://github.com/deniseyu) like everyone else, but for more details email me.
